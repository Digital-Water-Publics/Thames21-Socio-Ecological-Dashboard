# Thames21 Socio-Ecological Dashboard 
https://thames21ox.web.app/
## Purpose
This projects showcases an online dashboard hosting data from [Thames21 Socio-Ecological Data repo](https://github.com/Digital-Water-Publics). Users are invited to explore a map-based visualisation of social and
environmental data linked to local rivers in the Thames river basin district, learn about how water quality affects
well-being, and interact with the dashboard by contributing their own sentiment to the map.
