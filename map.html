            The <b>Sentiment Polarity Category</b> tells us how people feel when they mention a river in their 
            tweets. Sentiment polarity means whether the feelings they express in the language of their 
            tweets are positive or negative (or neutral). 
        </br></br>
           <i> How does the Sentiment Polarity Category algorithm work?</i>
        </br></br>
            First, we assign each tweet a score between 10 for extremely positive and -10 for extremely 
            negative (but tweets will usually fall somewhere in between). Then, we aggregate tweets at 
            four geographical scales, namely river basin district, management catchment, operational 
            catchment, and water body. At each scale, we then sort tweets classified into three categories:
            Negative Sentiment Engagement, which comprises tweets with a polarity score in the lower 
            third (between -3.336 and -0.59) and is coloured red on the map; Neutral Sentiment 
            Engagement, which comprises tweets with a polarity score in the middle third (between -
            0.059 and 0.303) and is coloured yellow; and Positive Sentiment Engagement, which 
            comprises tweets with a polarity score in the upper third (between 0.303 and 7.857) and is 
            coloured green. Each category contains roughly the same number of tweets.
